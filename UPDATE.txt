Update  : 22 / Giugno / 2002   JnEAT VERSION 1.2.1



1) the name of species is setted to default name : 'generation'||nn

2) the winner name is 'winner'||generation number||'_'||genome_id

3) the generation file ( point 1) is 'write' if are found a winner and/or if
   is expired 'print_every' parameter;

4) the log window can be modify 

5) the 'Start Simulation' panel , when select 'graph champion' during 'start'
   or 'start from last' phase, draw two graph :
    a)	first winner genome
    b)  the current genome with the best fitness  

6) in plot i have added a line for fitness of winner ; this line can be replace by
   the maximum fitness found;
   when has a winner the color change

7) the graphics and plotting routine it is recorrect for a wrong value numeric in plotting

8) the graph draw is recorrect

9) I have eliminate a 'Nan' condition in chartXY.update (Nan is : '1/0')

10) I have move the running and compute fitness / error from panel 'generatioo' to  'View graph' panel;
    now they are two panel:
    a) the genome executed (center)
    b) the text of statistics informations (right): fitness,error,weight,structure

11) the panel 'View graph' has a button for select :
    view net with  'width' of connection 
    view normal link with a 'width' = 1
    view fitness/error/population
    view normal information

12) is possible splitting from graph,curce text in 'generation' panel during simulation and at
    end of simulation (last results).
    


13) I have added a sample for 3 input and 1 out for a classic problem :
	the Parity Problem
    (the session file if session_parity)

For test the 'parity problem' with I/O from file :

a) in panel 'Session parameter ' load session file : 
         'session_parity' (press button 'Load sess file...' and select the file 'session_parity')
         
b) press the button 'Write sess'
c) press button  'Load sess default'
d) press button  'Load class fitness'
e) press button  'compile'

f) now you are ready to start the generation....

(i have found a solution with number of epoch < 80! : 'niente male !!' ).
